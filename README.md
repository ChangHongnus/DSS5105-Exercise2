# Ans: α = 95.97, τ = -9.11, β = 1.5149

# Question 1b) 
# Report the estimated ATE (ˆτ ) and its statistical significance.
# Ans: Estimated Average Treatment Effect (τ̂): −9.1057
#      p-value = 0 , which is less than 0.05, therefore the effect is statistically significant.

# Question 1c)
# Briefly explain under what assumptions ˆτ can be given a causal interpretation.
# Ans: The estimated treatment effect τ̂ can be interpreted causally if, given a corporation’s sustainability spending X, the decision to participate in the carbon offset program (W) is independent of potential stakeholder engagement scores (Y), all values of X include both treated and untreated firms, the relationship between Y, W, and X is correctly specified in the model, and each firm’s outcome Y is only affected by its own treatment status W.
